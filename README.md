## SongEdit

A tool to help you write song lyrics more efficiently. At its center, there's a text area to type and for every part of the song you can add a new one. When you select a word in one of the text areas, a new section will slide in from the bottom, showing rhymes, synonyms, related words and definitions of the selected word. Clicking one of these rhymes, synonyms, etc., copies the word to your clipboard. When finished writing, it's possible to export your lyrics to a PDF file.
